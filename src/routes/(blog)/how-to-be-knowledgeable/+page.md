Last week, we had a panel discussion to celebrate our one-year anniversary of Shopee React Knowledgeable.

**What is [Shopee React Knowledgeable (RK)](https://twitter.com/reknowledgeable)?** Shopee RK is a fun and friendly weekly podium for us frontend developers at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg) to share what we learn about web.

We've been consistently having our weekly RK for a year, thanks to all the developers sharing, especially [Wei](https://twitter.com/wgao19)

It's funny but it's true. You can't turn knowldegable in your field overnight, you got to put effort consistently every single day. And without you noticing, you get better, you start to know things.
