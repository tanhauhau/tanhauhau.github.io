- parameters that's available from `pageQuery`, comes from `context` when `createPage({})`.
eg:

```js
// gatsby-node.js
createPage({
    context: {
        slug: '123',
        foo: 'bar',
    }
})

// template/blog-post.js
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostBySlug($slug: String!, $foo: String!) {
  }
`
```

- if you are creating `slug` from page url, and it contains `<space>` characters, you might need to do 
`slug.replace(/\s+/g, '-')` as browser will `encodeUriComponent` of your path, and the slug may not match.

- graphql aliases https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases
  - allows you to rename the result field
