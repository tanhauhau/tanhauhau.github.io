## 3 tech lead wisdoms from @coderkungfu

### 1️⃣ dont panic

you've gotten to where you are because your years of experience. 
everything you've learned in the past has prepared you for this moment in your life.
you can do this. dont panic

### 2️⃣ silence can be a good thing

it is in silence where you can actually think.
dont rush into things.
take some time to ponder before taking the next step.


### 3️⃣ its okay to say you don't know

...because you really don't know!
but it's not okay to stay ignorant. take your time to find out and learn.

> you dont become a mentor just like that,
> just because you are technically good, you know your craft very well, does not automatically make you a good teacher and a good mentor
