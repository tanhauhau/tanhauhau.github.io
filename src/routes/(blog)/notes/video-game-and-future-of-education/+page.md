language is not strictly superior

mimicry is effective sometimes, language is effective sometimes
a fusion is superior to either alone

when you have language,
starts to be able to describe very hypothetical situation, -> stories
stories can be educational

spoken language -> written language
can be recorded, text can be kept unchanging -> law
text allow us to express exact, specific ideas,

the same knowledge at the core, but learning and practice become a different flavour
