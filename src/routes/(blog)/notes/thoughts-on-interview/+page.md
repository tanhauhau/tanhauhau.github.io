## Interview experience from @zhaojinjiang

- `@zhaojinjiang` shared some of his interview experience
  - he prepared a ton of questions, but in the end he used 1 question, bubble sort, to eliminate 80% of the candidate
  - he shared one of his prev boss classic interview question, given a DOM node, reverse all it's child element.
  - open-ended question, we have `insertBefore` and `appendChild`, so if you are given a chance to add a new api, `insertAfter`, explain how you would design the api.
