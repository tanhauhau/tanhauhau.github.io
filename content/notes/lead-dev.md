## How to scale yourself at the speed of Slack

[How to scale yourself at the speed of Slack](https://leaddev.com/how-scale-yourself-speed-slack)

- **No Parachute**
  - Your old job doesn't exists! (You cant go back anymore!)
1. Writing well (and quickly) is an incredible asset
   - always write down talking points
   - organise thoughts and ensure intent is clear
   - unorganised thoughts and talks in front of people -> lose credibility
2. Stories are very powerful
   - Pitching your team to candidates
   - Pitching your team's work to execs
3. Have a communications plan for everything
   - Don't YOLO the comms
4. Know your audience
   - down / sideways / up
   - **Just ask** what is on top of the others mind
5. "Too many meetings" is often a symptom of misalignment
6. Create structure and process around thing you do often
   - it's okay for the rest to be messy (things happen once in a year 🙈)
7. Always ask: "who is the decision maker?"
   - who will be held accountable for the decision
8. Credit always flows to the most senior/tenured/visible person naturally
   - making sure credit flows to less visible person who really need it
9. Leaders build organizations that mirror their personal strengths and weaknesses
    - because people who emulate the leaders will get promoted more easily
    - what is your biggest weakness and how do you compensate it in your hierachy?
    - how do you ensure hiring people that are like yourself?
    - how do you ensure diversity?
10. Treat people fairly and with respect. It's a tremendous privilege to be thier leader.

## Being right is only half the battle

[Being right is only half the battle](https://leaddev.com/being-right-only-half-battle-how-optimize-your-interpersonal-connections)

### How to read minds

Ask questions. **Ask questions** drives you to understand people

Play back and verify.

"What does ___ mean to you?"

"On a scale from 1 to 10, what do you feel about ___? How can I help you from `n` to `m`?"

### How to control reality

#### Specifying priorities / strategies

"Even over" - "we will focus on __ even over __"

eg: "fixing old bugs even over shipping new featuers", "quick iteration even over polished ui"

### How to predict future

- socialise and get feedbacks in the early stage
  - "How would you react if I said we should ...."
  - "What would worry you if we decided to ..."

Write things down and share it as widely as possible
