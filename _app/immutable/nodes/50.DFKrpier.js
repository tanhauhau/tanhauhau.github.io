All the internal state, memory is cleaned up by default by the browser.</p> <p>The way to communicate between different application is via:</p> <ul><li>the server</li> <li>the URL</li> <li>local storage, cookie, etc</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Route level Micro Frontend for Single-Page Application (SPA)</strong></p> <p>Similar to MPA where each page is a separate micro frontend, but for SPA, there's a layer below each micro frontend, that manages the history and routing, shared global state, (eg: user information) and shared common services (eg: authenticating.).</p> <p>Data can be shared across each micro frontend via:</p> <ul><li>browser history</li> <li>shared global state</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Component level Micro Frontend</strong></p> <p>Multiple micro frontends within a page.</p> <p>Communication is done via:</p> <ul><li>custom events</li> <li>component props or attributes, between outside and inside of the micro frontend component</li></ul> <p>Having multiple micro frontends within a page should be rare, as it is uncommon to have a page that has components that are so varied to the extent requires a separate team & deployment cycle for them. The communication cost would be high, and it is rare to have the upside outweigh the costs.</p></li></ul> <p>In this article, I will be mainly talking about <strong>Route level Micro Frontend for SPA</strong>.</p></section> <section><h1><a href="#benefits-of-micro-frontend" id="benefits-of-micro-frontend">Benefits of micro frontend</a></h1> <p>To consider whether you should implement micro frontend into your project, is to understand the benefits of micro frontend. So you know whether the trade-offs are worth the benefits it brings.</p></section> <section><h2><a href="#independent-development" id="independent-development">Independent development</a></h2> <p>The key to micro frontend, irrelevant to how we structure them, is to allow individual micro frontend be developed, tested, and deployed independently.</p> <p>Although rarely mentioned, but as the size of the SPA codebase scales, it gets slower and slower to develop and build it. Even the change you are going to make affects only one page, webpack will still have to parse through every file dependencies when it builds.</p> <p>A separate deployment process means you wouldn't need to parse/build unnecessary files.</p></section> <section><h2><a href="#autonomous-teams" id="autonomous-teams">Autonomous teams</a></h2> <p>A good micro frontend architecture should allow different teams to make different tech decision, eg libraries, build optimisation, etc.</p> <p>However, the freedom of tech decision might lead to a fractionated application.</p></section> <section><h1><a href="#the-problem" id="the-problem">The problem</a></h1> <p>By allowing independent development and autonomous teams might bring some unintended problems:</p></section> <section><h2><a href="#should-each-micro-frontend-choose-their-own-frontend-frameworks" id="should-each-micro-frontend-choose-their-own-frontend-frameworks">Should each micro frontend choose their own frontend frameworks?</a></h2> <p>Frontend framework nowadays commonly comes with a framework runtime. The extra cost of another framework should be considered when making the decision.</p> <p>Having said that, the micro frontend architecture should be framework agnostic. As frontend is a fast changing world, a better frontend archictecture could be created overnight. The micro frontend architecture should be open to different frameworks and open to experimentation.</p></section>`,1);function C(o,e){const n=m(e,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);a(e,!1),s("blog",{image:g}),c(),u(o,f(()=>n,()=>t,{children:(r,b)=>{var i=w();p(20),h(r,i)},$$slots:{default:!0}})),l()}export{C as component};
