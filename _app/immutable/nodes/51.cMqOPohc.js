The <a href="https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/App/Routes.js#L17" rel="nofollow">route definition</a> is dynamic, as it listens <code class="inline">"registerRoute"</code> event through <em>the Bridge</em>, and add it to the route definition.</p> <p>One thing to note is that, I use <code class="inline">&lt;Switch /&gt;</code>, which will render the first <code class="inline">&lt;Route /&gt;</code> that matches the url.</p> <p>The magic happens in the last route, which will be rendered when none of the routes in the route definition matches.</p> <p>The last route renders the <a href="https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/App/FallbackDiscovery.js" rel="nofollow">Fallback Discovery</a> component, which will based on the current location and some pre-defined rules, tries to find the micro frontend manifest for the unknown route.</p> <p>If the micro frontend manifest does not exist, it will render a 404 page. However, if the manifest exists, it will fetch the manifest file.</p> <p>The micro frontend manifest file is nothing but a json file that contains the <a href="https://github.com/tanhauhau/micro-frontend/blob/master/packages/base/src/App/FallbackDiscovery.js#L31" rel="nofollow">entry asset</a> for the route micro frontend.</p> <p>Once the entry asset is loaded, the new micro frontend itself will register a new route to the route definition via <code class="inline">"registerRoute"</code> event, which has to be the route that matches the current URL.</p> <p>Whenever there's a new route added, the <code class="inline">react-router</code>'s <code class="inline">&lt;Router /&gt;</code> component will re-render and it will match the newly added route, which renders our newly added micro-frontend.</p></section> <section><h2><a href="#the-global-registry" id="the-global-registry">The global registry</a></h2> <p>There's 2 main reasons why I am not bundling <code class="inline">react</code>, <code class="inline">react-redux</code>, and <code class="inline">react-router</code> into each micro frontends:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Bundle size</strong>, there's no reason to download duplicate copies of <code class="inline">react</code> or <code class="inline">react-redux</code>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>No multiple instance</strong>, both <code class="inline">react-redux</code> and <code class="inline">react-router</code> uses React Context to pass information down the React component tree.
