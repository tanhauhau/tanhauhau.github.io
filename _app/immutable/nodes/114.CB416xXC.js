Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus Outbreak, and having the Ministry of Health raising the alert to DORSCON Orange, the event was cancelled.</p> <p>Still, I feel this talk deserves to be "heard" by everyone interested, so I decided to write the talk out into writing.</p> <section><h2><a href="#abstract" id="abstract">Abstract</a></h2> <p>Chrome extension allows us to add features to our browser, personalize our development experience. One good example is React DevTools, which allows React Developers to inspect and debug virtual DOM through the Chrome DevTools.</p> <p>In this talk, I will be exploring <a href="#overview">how you can develop your Chrome extension</a>, and <a href="#what-you-can-do-with-chrome-extension">how you can use it to improve your development workflow</a>.</p> <p>Hopefully, at the end of the talk, you would be able to write your Chrome extension for your development workspace.</p></section> <section><h2><a href="#overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h2> <p>A Chrome extension is made up of several components, which can broken down into the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages" rel="nofollow">background scripts</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts" rel="nofollow">content scripts</a>, an <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/options" rel="nofollow">options page</a>, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/user_interface" rel="nofollow">UI elements</a>.</p> <p>The <strong>background scripts</strong> is like a background thread of your Chrome extension. It is where you can observe browser events and modify browser behaviors.</p> <p><strong>Content scripts</strong> run in the context of web pages. It is allowed to access and modify the DOM of the web pages. It is where you provide web pages information to the extension, as well as providing hooks for the web pages to communicate with the extension.</p> <p><strong>Options page</strong> is a standalone page, where users can modify the behavior of your Chrome extension.</p> <p>The <strong>UI elements</strong> are what we usually perceived of a chrome extension, which includes:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/user_interface#browser_action" rel="nofollow">browser action</a> <em>(the small icon in the toolbar beside the address bar)</em></li> <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/user_interface#popup" rel="nofollow">popup</a> <em>(the floating window shown when clicked on the toolbar icon)</em></li> <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/user_interface#context_menu" rel="nofollow">context menu</a> <em>(yes, you can customise your right-click context menu)</em></li> <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools" rel="nofollow">devtools panel</a> <em>(a new panel in the devtools)</em></li> <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/user_interface#override" rel="nofollow">custom pages</a> <em>(Overriding the History, New Tab, or Bookmarks page)</em></li></ul> <p><span style="display: block; position: relative; padding-top: 60.125%; width: 100%;"><picture><source type="image/webp"/><img loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%" alt="ui elements on extension"/></picture></span></p> <p>Now you know the different components of a Chrome extension, let's look at the most important file in every extension, the <code class="inline">manifest.json</code>.</p></section> <section><h2><a href="#manifest-json" id="manifest-json">manifest.json</a></h2> <p><code class="inline">manifest.json</code> is where you declare everything about the chrome extension:</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <p>You can declare all the UI elements inside the <code class="inline">manifest.json</code>. You can also programmatically enable them inside the background script.</p> <p>For example, React Devtools shows a different React logo when the site does not use React, uses development React and uses production React:</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <p>Notice that the <code class="inline">options_page</code>, <code class="inline">popup</code> of the <code class="inline">browser_action</code>, and <code class="inline">devtools_page</code> field takes in a path to a HTML page. You can treat the HTML page as any web app, which you can use any framework of your liking to build it. For example, React Devtools is built with React!</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <p><em>popup.html is just like any web app, that can be build with any web framework</em></p> <p>For the devtools page, you need to programmatically add panels to the devtools:</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div></section> <section><h2><a href="#communicating-between-components" id="communicating-between-components">Communicating between components</a></h2> <p>Since only the content script runs in the context of the web page, if your extension requires to interact with the web page, you would need some way to communicate from the content script to the rest of the extension.</p> <p>For example, the React Devtools uses the content script to detect React version, and notify the background script to update the page action icon appropriately.</p> <p>The communication between different components of the Chrome extension works by using <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging" rel="nofollow">message passing</a>. There is API for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging#simple" rel="nofollow">one-time request</a> as well as <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging#connect" rel="nofollow">long-lived connections</a>.</p> <p>The one-time request API works fine for a simple extension, but it gets messier when you have more communications going on between different parts of your extension.</p> <p>I studied how <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-devtools-core" rel="nofollow">React Devtools</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-devtools/OVERVIEW.md" rel="nofollow">works</a> in particular, because to show the updated React virtual DOM tree inside the devtools panel, a lot of communication is needed between the devtools and the content script.</p> <p>After some study and experimentation, I came up with the following architecture for my Chrome extension:</p> <ul><li>All the extension components (eg: popup, content script, devtools) maintained a long-lived connection with the background script</li> <li>The background script act as a central controller that receives messages from each component and dispatches them out to the relevant components</li> <li>Each component is like an actor in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" rel="nofollow">actor model</a>, where it acts on the messages received and sends out messages to the other actors where needed.</li></ul> <p><span style="display: block; position: relative; padding-top: 51.186%; width: 100%;"><picture><source type="image/webp"/><img loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%" alt="communication between components"/></picture></span></p></section> <section><h3><a href="#communicating-between-the-content-script-and-the-web-page" id="communicating-between-the-content-script-and-the-web-page">Communicating between the Content script and the web page</a></h3> <p>The content script runs in the context of the web page, which means it can interact with the DOM, such as manipulating the DOM structure and adding event listeners to the DOM elements.</p> <p>Besides, the content script can access the page history, cookies, local storage and other browsers' APIs in the context of the web page.</p> <p>However, the content script lives in a different global scope of the web page. Meaning, if your web application declared a global variable <code class="inline">foo</code>, it is not possible for the content script to access it.</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <p>and the converse is true too:</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <p>However, it is still possible for the content script to declare a variable into the web application, since it has access to the same DOM, it can do so by adding a script tag:</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#run_time" rel="nofollow">when you start running your content script</a>, the DOM may or may not have constructed when your content script is executed.</p></blockquote> <p>Still, you can't declare a variable from a web application into the content script scope.</p> <p>I stumbled upon an idea where your web application can "declare a variable" through the dom by creating a special DOM element for content script consumption only:</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <p>It is technically possible, though I wouldn't recommend it.</p> <p>Instead, you should use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage" rel="nofollow">window.postMessage</a> to communicate between the web page and the content script.</p> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <div class="code-section"><!></div> <blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to add an identifier field, eg: <code class="inline">"source"</code>, to the event data for filtering, you will be amazed by how much data is communicated through <code class="inline">window.postMessage</code> if you don't filter out events that are sent from your use.</p></blockquote></section> <section><h4><a href="#providing-a-hook-to-your-extension" id="providing-a-hook-to-your-extension">Providing a hook to your extension</a></h4> <p>If you installed <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi" rel="nofollow">React Devtools</a>, try type <code class="inline">__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__</code> in your console.
