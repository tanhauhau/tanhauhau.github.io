Rendering phase is no longer happening at one go, but split up into multiple small chunks.
And the tearing issue arise if the external state changes in the middle of rendering phase, causing part of the application rendered
with the old data, and part with the latest data.</p> <p>This somehow reminds me of the zombie child, stale props issue of redux: <a href="https://kaihao.dev/posts/Stale-props-and-zombie-children-in-Redux" rel="nofollow">https://kaihao.dev/posts/Stale-props-and-zombie-children-in-Redux</a></p>`,1);function A(a,e){const o=m(e,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);i(e,!1),r("blog",{image:f}),d(),u(a,g(()=>o,()=>t,{children:(n,x)=>{var s=w();c(8),h(n,s)},$$slots:{default:!0}})),p()}export{A as component};
